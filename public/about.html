<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Sayed Shabir Sharifi, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering (BSSE) at IMSciences, Peshawar, Pakistan. With a solid foundation in programming languages like C# for Unity Game development, along with expertise in web technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, I have developed a keen interest in both game and web development. In addition, I have practical experience in MYSQL and PHP for creating CRUD websites, which has further honed my technical skills. My educational journey is complemented by my passion for technology and innovation.</p>

<p>At IMSciences, I am actively working to deepen my knowledge of software engineering principles and practices. I am also gearing up to expand my skills in backend development, which I believe will play a crucial role in my future career. Alongside my studies, I have developed strong problem-solving and analytical skills, which I use to approach complex technical challenges. My goal is to become proficient in full-stack development and contribute to impactful software solutions in the future.</p>
